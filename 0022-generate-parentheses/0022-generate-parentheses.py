        # Time Complexity:
        #   - There are C_n valid sequences (n-th Catalan number).
        #   - Each sequence has length 2n, and building it costs O(n).
        #   - Total: O(C_n * n).
        #
        # Space Complexity:
        #   - Recursion stack depth = O(2n) = O(n).
        #   - Path buffer = O(n).
        #   - Result storage = O(C_n * n) (size of the output itself).
        #   - Auxiliary space (ignoring output): O(n).

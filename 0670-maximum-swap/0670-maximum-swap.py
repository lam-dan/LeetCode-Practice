        # swap_j:   index of the best right-side digit to bring forward

        # 1) Scan from right to left, maintaining (max_num, max_idx).
        # 2) If nums[i] < max_num, record (swap_i=i, swap_j=max_idx) â€” a better digit exists to the right.
        #    We keep updating swap_i as we move left so the final pair improves the leftmost possible position.
        # 3) After the scan, swap once using (swap_i, swap_j) and return the number.
